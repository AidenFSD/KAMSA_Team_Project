        <h3> My name is Roh Kwang Soo </h3>
        </p>
        <h6>
            <p>
                I’m a 65-year-old South Korean veteran.
                Please forgive me if you find my story about my dream idea to be a bit too wordy.
            </p>
            <p><strong>My company and I have been in the business of manufacturing and selling professional health and
                fitness equipment since 1994. My dream of making truly washable bedding started back in 2008</strong>
                when I was
                visiting a pillow factory. It was an exceptional and amazing experience to see a free-flowing liquid
                swell up and
                transform into fluffy memory foam.
            </p>
            <p>What really surprised me was the fact that these <strong>memory foams could never be washed.</strong>
                After the day they are created, even after being soaked with sweat, covered in yellow stains, and full
                of
                germs, mold, and mites, they can never be restored to their cleanly original state.
            </p>
            <p>The idea hit me one day that <strong>why couldn’t we coat the memory foam with a comfy membrane to render
                both the cover and insert truly washable? </strong>In all honesty, I didn’t expect that realizing this
                simple idea would
                <strong>take me more than 10 years.</strong>
                Only after I tried, I started to be aware that it's <strong>almost an impossible mission</strong> to
                find a material that could closely fit the memory foam and
                <strong>prevent any exterior messes</strong> from entering.
            </p>
        </h6>

    <div class="row fire">
        <div class="six columns">

            <h3>Against all odds</h3>
            <p> <strong>Countless tests of numerous materials </strong>and <strong>endless visits to research institutes, professors, and related factories</strong> made up
                a huge part of my routine life during the last decade. Before seeing the silver lining of all my efforts,
                on January 29, 2018, <strong>a fire burned my factory, machines, and materials to ashes.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Thanks to social media in South Korea, </strong>many people heard my story and shared <strong>thousands of encouraging and uplifting comments.</strong> My bleeding heart was healed, and</strong> I mustered the courage to start all over again.</strong>
                It was also at that time, some agencies reached out to me and suggested that they could buy my products and do a Kickstarter.
                This was also the first time I had ever heard of crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter. Therefore, they bought the products from me and did the Kickstarter by themselves.</p>

            <h3>Start clowdfunding</h3>
            <p>Then I decided to learn running the crowdfunding campaign to promote my products. In 2019,
                I launched 4 very successful pillow related campaigns in South Korea. My team and I have worked ceaselessly to satisfy each and every backer.</p>

            <h3>Wonderful Reviews.</h3>
            <p>Amidst the countless pieces of positive feedback my pillows received, I also noticed some backers were

            <h3>What is our next innovation?</h3>
            <p>This further strengthened my resolve to make a bed for our fur babies. My company has now been through it
                all: concept verification, experimenting, 3D modeling, sample making, prototyping, molding, testing, and
                iterating. We’re confident that we have created the most caring and comfortable pet bed on the market.

                This Kickstarter campaign is my company’s first step towards serving customers all around the world. It
                is also our first step in redefining the world’s bedding industry (for both pets and humans).
